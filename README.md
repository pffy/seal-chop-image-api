# **SealChop.com** is a simple seal chop image Web API. You can create Chinese or Korean seal chops.

### Quick Start

To get started, you can simply type the following URL into your browser:

```bash
https://png.sealchop.com/
```

You should see something similar to this:

<img width="200" src="https://png.sealchop.com/">

This is the default seal chop image that appears with no custom settings.

You can make a custom chop by adding parameters to the base URL.

For example, you can change the Chinese name by simply setting the `x` (xingming) parameter as follows:

```bash
https://png.sealchop.com/?x=貝聿銘
```

This will change the seal chop image to something similar to this:

<img width="300" src="https://png.sealchop.com/?x=貝聿銘">

You can also use Korean characters. For example, you can enter the following:

```bash
https://png.sealchop.com/?x=소정희
```

The image becomes a Korean seal chop.

<img width="300" src="https://png.sealchop.com/?x=소정희">
